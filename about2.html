    <h1>About This Site</h1>

    <p>
   This site is a personal project created for my COAP 2000 course. It explores my interests in design, user experience, and digital storytelling, while giving me space to practice HTML and CSS. The website centers around vinyl records, combining my love for music with visual design and interactive layouts.

    <h1>About Me as the Designer</h1>

    <p>
      I am a student studying Anthropology and Interactive Digital Media with an
      interest in UX and CX research. I enjoy creating thoughtful, human-centered
      designs and using this site to explore my interest in vinyl records as well as a space to experiment and improve my webs building skills.
